## Why? (Motivation behind this repo)

> Creating blog posts + open-source code + study notes in one shot

While I am studying, I am generating a lot of content, so I decided to take advantage of github to help me to organize my studies and distribute these contents through blog posts and this public repository. I just have to follow my regular study workflow and a blog post will be generated automatically by the github robot, which I programmed to create a blog post from the `README.md` of a module (folder inside `learning`).

- Organize study notes and codes
- Integration with github profile
- Integration with blog - Not implemented yet
